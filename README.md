# Intermediate R: Machine Learning

## Description

This four week course introduces participants to implementation of machine learning methods in R using RStudio. Each two hour session will include brief tutorials interspersed with challenge exercises, and assumes attendees are familiar with basic R syntax, using packages, and basic data manipulation using tidyverse. The course also assumes a strong foundation in basic statistics as well as prior/concurrent participation in the fredhutch.io course Concepts in Machine Learning (or equivalent experience). At the end of this course, you will be able to apply basic principles of machine learning to research questions and will have established a foundation for further exploration of machine learning techniques.

**Required software**: Software requirements for this course can be found on [fredhutch.io's Software page](http://www.fredhutch.io/software/). The HackMD (interactive page used for sharing links and information) for this course is here: https://hackmd.io/@k8hertweck/RML

## Schedule

- Week 1: Conceptual Overview; CRISP-DM framework; EDA; Our Tools
- Week 2: Case Study in Regression
- Week 3: Case Study in Classification
- Week 4: Case Study in Deep Learning and Transfer Learning
