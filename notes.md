# Course objectives

## Class 1: Data import, cleaning, visualization

* Import a simple dataset and explore different qualitative and quantitative aspects of the data
* Perform simple cleaning and visualization with single variables using the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
* Prepare the data for further analysis by engineering new features (columns) from existing numeric and categorical features
* Discuss how writing functions and classes can save considerable effort by allowing us to maintain control over inputs and avoid repetitious editing.

## Class 2 objectives: Regression    

>Moved to class2.md

## Class 3 objectives: Classification    

>Moved to class3.md

## Class 4 objectives: PCA

- Explain why we might want to create a lower-dimension representation of a dataset.
- Explain the curse of dimensionality
- Explain the conceptual basis of PCA (principal component analysis) and what is meant by subsequent PCs
- Describe how PCA is used in practice and when to avoid using it.

# Notes

- These are mainly just copied over from python course, might need to add in R specific language/content
- I am not seeing (based on this plan) where we'd fit in information about other packages for ML in R
  - Could we combine classification and regression? Make class 4 about other R packages?
